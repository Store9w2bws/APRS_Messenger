Serial terminal program to setup the serial or USB versions of the APRS TNC Digi Tracker

Can use any PC Comm port up to Comm 255 including USB serial comm ports

Receive only Igate for VHF APRS

Can be used with the AX25-SCS DSP TNC program

The latest version 1.07 has a new UTC clock in the program frame to match other CCW programs.

Version v1.05 has some additional buttons for setting up the Bluetooth module and a minor bug fix.

Version v1.04 has the facility to change baud rate so that it can be used with all versions of the APRS TNC Digi Tracker including the new Bluetooth version that runs at 38.4 kb. It also has extra buttons to access all items in the Digi Tracker firmware and programming files for the Bluetooth device.

Version 1.02 has the facility to work with the AX25-SCS DSP TNC program so that it can be used without a hardware TNC as a very simple to set up Igate or it can be used with a hardware TNC and two receivers to send two APRS traffic streams to the APRS-IS. For example local APRS and APRS from the International Space Station or HF and VHF APRS This version will run on all versions of Windows and uses minimal CPU resources so will run well on older PC's.
APRS Messenger Lite has also been tested running on Linux on Ubuntu 10.04 running on Wine.

A Windows installer for the AX25-SCS DSP TNC program can be downloaded here. This will allow the installation of AX25-SCS and the drivers needed for Windows PCs.

Although the program is designed to promote the new USB version of our APRS TNC Digi Tracker it will work with other serial TNC's.

The APRS Messenger Lite Help file can be downloaded here.

How to use...Open the program, select the baud rate then select the Comm port that the serial TNC or APRS TNC Digi Tracker is connected to.
Incoming data can be read in the "Received Data" box as it arrives.
If nothing appears click on "Disp" to get the TNC to send some data to check the connection.

When it's receiving data OK, type your callsign and SSID in the "My callsign:" box and your APRS-IS passcode (same as the UI-View one) in the "APRS-IS passcode:" box.
Click on the "Connect to server" button and if you are connected to the internet it will start working as a receive only Igate sending local APRS packets to the APRS-IS system for worldwide display.
Easy!

APRS is an international network of amateur radio stations providing real-time GPS based vehicle or event position reporting, weather reporting and simple message handling for educational, experimental or emergency use. APRS uses a common radio frequency of 144.800 MHz throughout Europe. Digital repeating (digipeating) is used to extend the range of mobile and low power stations over a wider area. In addition to the radio network internet gateways provide a two-way port to the APRS-IS (APRS Internet System) so that stations local to the gateway can be seen worldwide on APRS viewing programs such as Xastir or UI-View.

APRS over PSK and GMSK is a new mode allowing mobile or fixed station APRS operation on HF from remote areas away from the coverage of the VHF APRS network. Using 10.1497 MHz as a common frequency in Europe and the USA a typical range of 400 to 2000 miles from fixed and mobile stations using modest equipment can be expected. There are several Igates operating in Europe and the USA transferring received packets and messages from 7.0497 and 10.1497 MHz to the APRS-IS.
